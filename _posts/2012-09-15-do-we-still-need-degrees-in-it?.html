NO, most likely.

Spending 3 years making datamapper more valuable than degree

In business/psichology needed because its easy to talk a lot of bullshit. In IT, talking bullshit is impossible thanks to FizzBuzz

Can learn stuff on the internet (ComputerVision e.g.) and can also easily test if he actually knows Computer Vision.
