## I am Andreas Arnold, and I am a Code Poet.

![Andreas Arnold](/images/andreasarnold.jpg)

I am a developer, gamer and lover of music. In my free time you can also occasionally see me on my motorcycle. I started this blog since I wanted to get better at English and Ruby, and because I wanted to give something back to the community. You can contact me via email or twitter.

This blog is intended to offer the newest ideas and opinions around the Ruby web development world, be that Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Coffeescript, CSSS, HTML5, and countless other topics.

If you like what I do, you should also consider [hiring me as a freelancer, part-time or full time!](/hireme/)
