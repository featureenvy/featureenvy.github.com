Hiring me? Why you might ask. It’s a fair question. Short version: I am looking for work as a freelancer, part-time, full-time or remote employee. At best in a front-end engineering position, so I can compromise a lot for a good engineering culture.

And there is one other important aspect (sorry for the profanity, but it really **is** good):

## Do You Want Motivated Engineers?

Then you probably want me. The more I work with IT, the more I understand, the more I want to know about everything that goes on around me. I have to know how UX works. I have to know how scaling works. I have to know how protocols work. Pretty much anything you can think of, it probably interests me!

If you want someone who want someone to follow you on every word, who does exactly what you want. And never challenges you and your way of doing things? Then you don’t want me. Sorry. Because I will probably do this. I like things to work the way I think is best. Though feel free to point out to me why your way is better, I’m here to learn.

## What Am I Looking For
I’m looking for an engineering-driven company. One that values its engineering. One that tries to teach them everything, and supports them wherever they can. You know what Scrum is, but you don’t have to use it if you have a better way for your company.

You know the value of conferences and try to send employees to as many as you can so they can improve even more.

Mentoring is a given for you, hell, it’s even required that you either be a mentee or mentor someone in your company, because you know that’s the way we can improve the fastest.

Apart from that, I’m pretty open. Of course, I love Ruby. I love CoffeeScript. And I especially starting to develop a special kind of love for front-end engineering. Because showing data clearly, and letting people interact with it simply, is one of the things that can make or break a product.

## Didn't You Just Start Studying?
Yes, that is true. But the only reason I am doing this is so I can get an interesting job. If I can get an interesting job without a masters, then there is no reason to get one!

This is also why I mention part-time jobs, because I have roughly 40% each week to work, so I could even do both!

## I Want To Hire You!
Cool! Than contact me either via email or twitter, and I will get back to you as fast as possible!
