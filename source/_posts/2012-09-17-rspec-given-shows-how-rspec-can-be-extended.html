Just recently <a href="https://twitter.com/jimweirich" title="Jim Weirich on Twitter" target="_blank">Jim Weirich</a> released <a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rspec-given" title="rspec-given" target="_blank">rspec-given 2.0</a>, an extension to the RSpec DSL. It tries to add <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >given</span>, <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >when</span>, <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >then</span> semantics to RSpec. Why? Because <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >given</span>, <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >when</span>, <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >then</span> state <strong>intent</strong>. So everything in a <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >given</span> will be something that you expect to be present. <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >when</span> is the part that should actually be tested and <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >then</span> states what should happen.

This makes it easier to see what is just a test helper, which code is actually under test and what should happen to the different moving parts. Go read the <a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rspec-given/blob/master/README.md" title="rspec-given readme" target="_blank">readme in the rspec-given repository</a>, Jim does a way more thorough job at explaining the semantics. Or if you know Cucumber, you can just continue! For the rest, I will be waiting, right here.

Back already? Good! Let's continue!

<h2>A Primer on RSpec Given</h2>

So, if we want to write a Math library that uses a very strange notation, a spec could look like this:
<pre class="lang:ruby decode:true " >describe "Math" do
	describe "#+" do
		it "adds two values" do
			let(:value_one) { 2 }
			let(:value_two) { 3 }

			Math.+ value_one, value_two

			Math.result.should == 5
		end
	end
end</pre> 

I know, I know, it's a very contrived example, sorry... :(

But what are we testing now? <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >Math.+</span> or <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >Math.result</span>?

With rspec-given, we could specify intent a lot clearer:
<pre class="lang:ruby decode:true " >describe "Math" do
	describe "#+" do
		context "adds two values" do
			Given(:value_one) {2}
			Given(:value_two) {3}

			When { Math.+ value_one, value_two }

			Then { Math.result.should == 5 }
		end
	end
end</pre> 

So we have two preconditions (setting <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >value_one</span> and <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >value_two</span>), which are just there to help the test. Then we have the code we actually want to test (<span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >Math.+</span>). And we have a post condition, that needs to be true at the end. But in the second example it is clear that we don't test <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >Math.result</span>, but <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >Math.+</span>! Also notice that <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >then</span> replaces the need for an <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >it</span> block.

I guess we all can agree that the second example is way more specific which code is there for what purpose. Which I like.

But that got me to ask one question: How do you extend the DSL? Let's see:

<h2>Extending DSLs</h2>
First things first (because it wouldn't make sense to mention the first thing at the end I guess? That saying has never made sense to me, sorry...), I'm looking at rspec-given-2.0.0.beta3. This way, Jim can't ninja change things in there and then tell me I'm totally wrong.

Second things second (that doesn't exist, does it?): Let's have a look at the first file: <a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rspec-given/blob/rspec-given-2.0.0.beta.3/lib/rspec/given.rb" title="rspec/given" target="_blank">rspec/given.rb</a>. If we ignore RSpec 1 (someones still using that?), we include different files. One of the interesting files is configure.rb. Here the important lines (actually, all lines in this file except the includes):
 
<pre class="lang:ruby decode:true " >RSpec.configure do |c|
  c.extend(RSpec::Given::ClassExtensions)
  c.include(RSpec::Given::InstanceExtensions)
  c.include(RSpec::Given::HaveFailed)
end</pre> 
(<a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rspec-given/blob/rspec-given-2.0.0.beta.3/lib/rspec/given/configure.rb#L5-9" title="configure.rb" target="_blank">On Github</a>)

He uses RSpec.configure to extend and include a few extensions. If we take a look at RSpecs rubydocs, we can find <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/rspec/rspec-core/RSpec#configure-class_method" title="RSpec.configure" target="_blank">RSpec.configure</a>. Even more important, the Configuration object has two methods: <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >extend</span> and <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >include</span>! Now that's handy, because that's exactly what we used!

These two are really similar. <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/rspec/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration#extend-instance_method" title="Configure#extend" target="_blank">#extend</a> is used to add methods to example groups (but not the examples itself). It is added to the <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >describe</span> block, but not the <span class="lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline " >it</span> block.

Now guess what <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/rspec/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration#include-instance_method" title="Configure#include" target="_blank">#include</a> does. Right! It adds methods to the example itself, but not to the example group!

Now we know how we can add custom stuff to RSpec examples and example groups! Which is exactly what rspec-given does!

The class and instance extensions can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rspec-given/blob/rspec-given-2.0.0.beta.3/lib/rspec/given/extensions.rb" title="extensions.rb" target="_blank">extensions.rb</a>.

<h2>That's How You Extend a DSL</h2>
RSpec nicely enough provided everything we need to extend it's syntax with our own methods. Of course this isn't just handy for rspec-given. Everyone can extend RSpec with its own syntax, which might come in handy once in a while.

I suggest you have a look at the <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/rspec/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration" title="RSpec Configuration" target="_blank">RSpec Configuration object</a>, because it can actually do  a lot. Did you know that it can show you the 10 slowest examples, automatically? Or that RSpec has <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/rspec/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Hooks" title="RSpec Hooks" target="_blank">before, after, and around hooks</a>?

So not only have we learned what rspec-given is, how it works, but also how we can extend RSpec ourselves! Thanks Jim!
